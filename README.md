# DNA-6mA-Project
This project explores the utilization of DNA N6-methyladenosine (6mA) modification as a storage medium for achieving information storage at the kilobyte (KB) scale. The 6mA epigenetic mark, known for its regulatory roles in various biological processes, is repurposed here as a novel and precise means to encode and store digital information within the DNA molecule. This approach integrates biochemical manipulation with information theory, offering a unique bridge between molecular biology and data storage technology.

The project encompasses a comprehensive dataset derived from authentic experimental records, including detailed measurements, high-resolution images, and analytical figures that underpin the findings. These data not only validate the feasibility of using 6mA modifications for information encoding but also demonstrate the robustness and fidelity of this method. Additionally, the results include carefully designed figures intended for academic publication, which visually illustrate the mechanisms, workflow, and performance metrics of the 6mA-based storage system.

By leveraging the natural language of DNA and its epigenetic modifications, this work represents a pioneering step toward next-generation bio-inspired data storage solutions, with potential implications for long-term archival storage and synthetic biology applications. While the current implementation focuses on proof-of-concept at the KB scale, it lays the groundwork for scaling up to higher capacities and exploring practical use cases in the future.
